Week 6 exercises for Reverse Engineering Data (RED).

Provided is a file called stream.zustr. This is a multimedia file in the
experimental ZUyd STReaming format. ZUSTR files simply chop up multiple streams
in packets of some size and prefix them with an ID (which identifies which
packets belong together) and a SIZE (which describes the amount of data a
packet contains). So a ZUSTR file contains a contiguous array of the following
structure, where blocks that share the same ID belong together:

ID, SIZE, DATA, ID, SIZE, DATA, ID, SIZE, DATA, ID, SIZE, DATA

This particular stream contains two media streams: IMAGE (frames) and SUB
(text). The SUBs are easy (just text). The IMAGEs are in the experimental Zuyd
Image Format. ZIF files have the following structure:

"ZIF1", WIDTH, HEIGHT, REMAINING-SIZE,
"COLR", PALETTE-SIZE, PALETTE-DATA,
"DATA", DATA-SIZE, PIXEL-DATA

Complete the following exercises:

1. Recover the image data.
   a. What do the images contain (visually)?
   b. Can you convert the data to some mainstream format?
2. Recover the subtitles.
   a. What is the full text?
3. How are the images and subtitles related?

Good luck!
